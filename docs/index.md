# Toonify API

Welcome to the documentation for the Toonify API!

We provide API access to the Toonification model made famous by [Toonify Yourself](https://toonify.justinpinkney.com) _and there will be more models to come in the future!_

The API is accessible through RapidAPI (who take care of all the authentication and billing for us). Please [sign up for an API key](https://rapidapi.com/justinpinkney/api/toonify) there to try it out.

If you have an API key take a look at our [Getting Started tutorial](user-guide/getting-started).

This is an early version of the API, more capabilities and models will be coming in the future. If you've got any feedback please create an issue on GitHub, or reach out to me [on Twitter](twitter.com/buntworthy).
