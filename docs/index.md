# Toonify API

Welcome to the documentation for the Toonify API!

We provide API access to the Toonification model made famous by [Toonify Yourself](https://toonify.justinpinkney.com) _and there will be more models to come in the future!_

The API is accessible through RapidAPI (who take care of all the authentication and billing for us). Please [sign up for an API key](https://rapidapi.com/justinpinkney/api/toonify) there to try it out.

__If you have an API key then take a look at our [Getting Started tutorial](getting-started).__

This is an early version of the API, more capabilities and models will be coming in the future. If you've got any feedback please create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/justinpinkney/toonify-api-docs/issues), or reach out to me [on Twitter](twitter.com/buntworthy).
