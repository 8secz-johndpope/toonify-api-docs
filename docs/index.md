# Toonify API

_Welcome to the documentation for the Toonify API!_

We provide API access to the Toonification model made famous by [Toonify Yourself](https://toonify.photos) and [other models too.](models)

The API is accessible through RapidAPI (who take care of all the authentication and billing for us). Please [sign up for an API key](https://rapidapi.com/toonify-toonify-default/api/toonify/details) first.

__If you have an API key then take a look at our [Getting Started tutorial](getting-started).__

__Or if you just want to start making request check out our [interactive endpoint explorer](https://toonify.photos/api/interactive) to start getting results staight away.__

!!! warning 
        The RapidAPI interactive endpoint explorer does not properly send requests as multipart/form-data. It won't work, so please don't use it.

If you've got any feedback please create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/justinpinkney/toonify-api-docs/issues), or reach out to me [on Twitter](twitter.com/buntworthy).
